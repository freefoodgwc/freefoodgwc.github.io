  <h2>Tips on Healthy Eating</h2>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <div class=transbox>
    <p style="font-size:24px;"> 1. Slow down on the sodium</p>
    <p style="font-size:24px;"> 2. Pile up on the fruits and vegetables</p>
    <p style="font-size:24px;"> 3. Eat less fats</p>
    <p style="font-size:24px;"> 4. Cook at home- Cooking at home is not only a great way to make sure the ingredients are healthy, but portions are correct.</p>
    <p style="font-size:24px;"> 5. Base your meals on starchy carbohydrates- Some people think starchy foods are fattening, but gram for gram the carbohydrate they contain provides fewer than half the calories of fat.</p>
    <p style="font-size:24px;"> 6. Eat lots of fruits and vegetables.</p>
    <p style="font-size:24px;"> 7. Eat more fish- Fish is a good source of protein and contains many vitamins and minerals. Aim to eat at least two portions of fish a week, including at least one portion of oily fish. Oily fish contains omega-3 fats, which may help to prevent heart disease.</p>
    <p style="font-size:24px;"> 8. Cut down on saturated fats and sugar.</p>
    <p style="font-size:24px;"> 9. Eat less salt.</p>
    <p style="font-size:24px;"> 10. Be active.</p>
    <p style="font-size:24px;"> 11. Keep Drinking- We need to drink plenty of fluids to stop us getting dehydrated. The government recommends 6-8 glasses every day. Even unsweetened fruit juice and smoothies are high in free sugar. Your combined total of drinks from fruit juice, vegetable juice and smoothies should not be more than 150ml a day – which is a small glass.</p>
    <p style="font-size:24px;"><b> 12. DON'T SKIP BREAKFAST!!</b></p>
